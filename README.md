# Mbongeni’s Style Boutique —
# P-2 Website Update Log  
**Date:** 29 September 2025  

## What I Worked On

Today I focused on refining the layout and user experience of my fashion brand’s website. I wanted the site to feel premium, responsive, and true to the South African heritage that inspires my designs.

## Changes I Made

### 1. Fixed Navigation Bar  
- Made the main navigation bar stay at the top of the screen using `position: fixed`.  
- Added `z-index: 1000` and `box-shadow` for layering and visual depth.  
- Increased `padding-top` on the header to prevent content overlap.

### 2. Resized Images  
- Blog and product images were too large and disrupted the layout.  
- Added `max-width` and `max-height` constraints to keep visuals clean and proportional.  
- Ensured images scale properly across devices.

### 3. Responsive Layout  
- Added media queries for mobile screens.  
- Navigation links stack vertically on smaller devices.  
- Adjusted font sizes and padding for better readability.

### 4. Styling Enhancements  
- Gold accents for headings, buttons, and hover effects to match the brand’s luxury vibe.  
- Consistent typography using `'Poppins', sans-serif`.  
- Clean spacing and dark background for a bold, elegant aesthetic.

## Navigation Header Issues I Solved

This part gives me a headache.
- Initially, the nav bar scrolled with the page — not ideal for a boutique site.  
- After fixing it to the top, it started covering the header content.  
- I had to tweak layout spacing and header padding to make everything line up properly.  
- Now it’s smooth, fixed, and looks great across devices.

##  Next Steps
- Add a mobile menu toggle for smaller screens  
- Create dropdowns for categories like “Women,” “Men,” and “Kids”  
- Add scroll animations or transitions for extra polish  
- Build a featured product slider or carousel  

## Final Thoughts
I’m proud of how the site is shaping up even thou its still need the same look and feel.  
It’s clean, stylish, and rooted in the culture that inspires my brand.  
This update was a big step forward — and I’m just getting started.



# Mbongeni’s Style Boutique —  
# P-3 Website Update Log  
**Date:** 04 November 2025  

## What I Worked On  
This phase focused on enhancing interactivity, visual polish, and preparing the site for public launch. I wanted the boutique experience to feel bold, loud, and culturally expressive.

## Changes I Made  
### 1. Add to Cart Functionality  
- Implemented JavaScript logic to store selected items in `localStorage`.  
- Each product now adds to cart with a confirmation alert.  
- Cart persists across sessions and pages.

### 2. Section-Based Filtering  
- Category buttons (Women, Men, Kids, Coming Soon) now filter products dynamically.  
- Each homepage category image links directly to its section in `shop.html`.

### 3. Social Media Integration  
- Added social icons using Boxicons in both footer and dedicated section.  
- Styled hover effects and responsive layout for mobile.

### 4. Fancy Animations  
- Introduced `fadeIn`, `slideUp`, and `bounceFade` animations for headers and product cards.  
- Enhanced hover effects with scale and shadow transitions.

### 5. README, CSS and JS Cleanup   
- Updated `README.md` to reflect new progress.  
- Refactored `Shop.css` and `styles.css` for consistency and clarity.
- Refactored 'Shop.html (Search Bar Functionalty and error handling)
  
## Next Steps  
- Fixing `cart.html` to display selected items  
- Add featured product carousel  
- Optimize image loading and performance  
- Begin SEO and analytics setup

## Final Thoughts  
This update brought the boutique to life.  
From bold visuals to interactive cart features, it now feels like a real shopping experience.  
I’m excited to keep building — the vision is becoming reality.
